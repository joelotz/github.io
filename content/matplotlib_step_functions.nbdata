Excerpt: This week I had to make a “burn chart”, essentially a chart showing amount of work per week. Since the weeks are discrete time steps I need a step function. I started playing with horizontal and vertical lines but luckily I quickly found that matplotlib has a step function. Unfortunately, it didn’t quite act as I thought.
