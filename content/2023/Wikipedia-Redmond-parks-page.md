This is not a very exciting post, but I wanted to document some progress I’ve made lately. In a desire to get out of the house and explore my new city, I’ve spent the past couple months documenting all the parks in my city. First, I mapped them in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) with all the complete tags. Here is an image created from this [Overpass-Turbo query](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1t0I). The blue areas are City of Redmond parks and the red areas are King County parks within Redmond city limits.

Then I took pictures of all the park signs and published them to [wikimedia commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) under a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en). Here is a link to [Category:Parks in Redmond, Washington](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Parks_in_Redmond,_Washington) where anyone can view or post their Redmond park images. 

Finally, I created a wikipedia page titled [Parks in Redmond, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_in_Redmond,_Washington) with the images and data from the Redmond Parks Dept to share with the internet. It was a bit of work, but like I said, it was also an excuse to get out of the house on a Saturday when it wasn’t raining.
